As with Glider PRO's Room Editor, custom backgrounds, sounds, and TV videos
are supported.

Since Glider PRO used formats that were very Mac-specific, Aerofoil has
replaced most of them with more current formats.

To add resources to a house, create a ZIP file with the extension ".gpa" with
the same name as the .gpd and .gpf files that already exist for the house.

You can add resources by adding them to a folder named as the resource type,
with the appropriate extension.

For example, for a "PICT" resource of ID "3000", create a file named "3000.bmp"
and put it in the "PICT" directory in the .gpa archive.

PICT resources, used for custom decorations and backgrounds, must be BMP files.

Sounds should go in a directory named "snd$20"
Sounds must be WAV format, monaural, 8-bit unsigned PCM, 22255 Hz.
Sounds recorded at a different sample rate will play back at the wrong speed.
Sounds that are not monaural or 8-bit unsigned PCM will fail to load.

Resource IDs must be between -32768 and 32767.  Other resource IDs will fail
to load.
