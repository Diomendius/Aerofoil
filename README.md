# About Aerofoil

Aerofoil is a port of John Calhoun's Glider PRO, the classic paper airplane game for Apple Macintosh computers released in 1994.

The port features a 90's-style GUI, gamepad support, high-quality upscaling and color correction, a full port of the level editor, a set of import tools for unpacking and converting the vast majority of existing community content, and a new touchscreen interface for mobile devices.
