# About Aerofoil

Aerofoil is a port of John Calhoun's Glider PRO, the classic paper airplane game for Apple Macintosh computers released in 1994.

The port features a 90's-style GUI, gamepad support, high-quality upscaling and color correction, a full port of the level editor, a set of import tools for unpacking and converting the vast majority of existing community content, and a new touchscreen interface for mobile devices.

# HELP WANTED: Linux, macOS, and iOS port maintainers

I'm looking for contributors to help get Aerofoil on more operating systems!

Most of Aerofoil's system-specific features already have SDL, GLES2, POSIX, and C++11 versions, so the vast majority of the work needed to bring it to more operating systems is already done.  I mostly just need someone to set up projects, implement a few minor system-specific features (like storage directory paths), and build the binaries.

If you're interested in helping bring this classic game to more systems, please comment on one of the open issues in the issue tracker.
